<h2 id = Abstract> Abstract</h2>
<h4>The mobile phone is stimulating one of the most important technological revolutions in human history. This article first presents impacts, challenges, and predictions of mobile phone use. It first indicates that the impact of the mobile phone on society has been predominantly positive while the mobile phone has certain negative attributes. It then discusses multiple ways to overcome mobile technology challenges (e.g., new radio technologies and specialized devices optimized for medical, educational, or “Internet of things” applications). The authors predict that, in the two or three more generations, mobile phones use will have exciting advances to achieve the full benefits, especially in the area of healthcare, education, industry, daily life, learning, and collaborations, which will be more effective, productive, and creative. </h4>

<h2 id = Impact> Impact</h2>
<h4>By far, the greatest contribution to society of the mobile phone is in improved productivity. People act more efficiently when they are connected, especially when they are connected whenever, wherever, and to whomever they wish. Beyond that, the mobile phone is an invaluable tool that can entertain, educate, improve safety, and add convenience to our lives.In the early days, the cost of a call was high: 50 cents a minute. In the U.S., customers paid for incoming calls, making them reluctant to give out their cell phone number. As prices for service fell, especially after the assignment of more channels in the early 1990s, incoming calls and their related annoying alerts became more prominent. Consequently, smaller handheld units and the slow reduction of usage charges started to change people's expectations—cellphones were becoming even more useful than fixed phones. We started to see—or rather, hear—phones in movie theaters and concert halls.</h4>

<h2 id = Challenges> Challenges</h2>
<h4>We are still in the early days of mobile phone development. Only a small fraction of the mobile phone's potential has been unlocked. Services, especially Internet access, are too costly, as are the phones themselves. Smartphones try to do all things for all people but do none optimally. Mobile phones are designed as mass-market commodities without regard for the fact that people are unique and that different people benefit from phones designed for their unique needs.</h4>

<h2 id = Prediction> Prediction</h2>
<h4>We predict a world in which the mobile phone makes the most advanced medical technology available to all, as it helps solve the dilemma of a healthcare system focused on curing diseases rather than preventing them.

We predict a society in which mobile-phone-enhanced education occurs 24 hr a day everywhere—not just in the classroom; in which students are educated in stimulating ways; in which the knowledge of the world is available to all.

We predict an industrial society in which hierarchical organizations give way to collaborative self-organized entities in continuous communications with one another.

We predict a technological revolution in which the wireless technologies we espouse become either invisible, transparent, or intuitive, with the sole function of serving us as they make our lives better, and hopefully simpler.<h4>
