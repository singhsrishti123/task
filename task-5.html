<h2 id="about" style="margin-top:300px;">About Me </h2>



<p>Despite facing financial hardships, my father never fails to fulfill my genuine requirements. He ensures that I never experience feelings of inadequacy.<br>
 He willingly exerts great effort, working tirelessly to increase his earnings for my sake. He willingly sacrifices his own comfort,<br>
 sometimes even going without proper meals, just to take care of me.</p>
 
<hr>
<p>What sets my father apart is his unwavering belief in allowing me to choose my own career path. He does not impose his own profession on me.<br>
Instead, he encourages me to follow my own interests, capabilities, and suitability. However, he desires nothing more than a brighter future for his son.</p>
